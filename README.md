Features


Image Detection: Upload images and detect objects with YOLO v8.
Video Detection: Upload video files for frame-by-frame object detection.
Live Webcam Detection: Real-time object detection from live webcam feed.
Dynamic User Interface: User-friendly web interface with four main buttons (Home, Image, Video, Live Webcam).
Real-Time Results: Display detected objects directly on the page without saving files by default.
